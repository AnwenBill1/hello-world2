# hello-world2
my reminder work for how to create a repository on GitHub
# This is a comment
# each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners
# text info about anything then select PREVEIW
# You can then review the changes made to the file - if you select "show diff" any new content will appear in green

# next you can "commit changes"...
#In the "Commit message" field, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message. For more information, see "Creating a commit with multiple authors."

#Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request. For more information, see "Creating a pull request."https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo
